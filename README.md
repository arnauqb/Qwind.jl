# Qwind: Modelling UV line-driven winds originating from accretion discs

Qwind is a code that aims to simulate the launching and acceleration phase of line-driven winds in the context of AGN accretion discs. Refer to [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02742) for an explanation on the physics of the code.
