# QWIND



QWIND is a computer code that models radiation-driven winds originating from accretion discs.

The wind is modelled as a set of gas trajectories initialising from the surface of the accretion disc. The trajectories are computed by solving the equation of motion given by the radiation and gravitational force. To compute the radiation force, the radiation field is simulated across the wind, taking into account the disc as an extended source and a point-like source at the centre which aims to represent the X-ray corona.
