# Setup

The code is written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language. If you are not familiar with it, don't worry! To run the code at a higher level you will need very little Julia knowledge, although I would encourage you to use it for your scientific computing projects. Refer to [the official web-page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.

The easiest way to install QWIND is through the Julia package index.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Qwind")
```

This will automatically install any dependencies you may need.
